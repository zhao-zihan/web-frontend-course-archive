        <p>
          Jellyfish and sea jellies are the informal common names given to the
          medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa,
          a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are mainly
          free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing
          tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather
          than being mobile. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for
          highly efficient locomotion. The tentacles are armed with stinging
          cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators.
          Jellyfish have a complex life cycle; the medusa is normally the sexual
          phase, which produces planula larvae that disperse widely and enter a
          sedentary polyp phase before reaching sexual maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the
          deep sea. Scyphozoans (the "true jellyfish") are exclusively marine,
          but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater.
          Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones
          worldwide. The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature
          within a few months then die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage,
          attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived. Jellyfish have
          been in existence for at least 500 million years,[1] and possibly 700
          million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures. They are considered
          a delicacy in some Asian countries, where species in the Rhizostomae
          order are pressed and salted to remove excess water. Australian
          researchers have described them as a "perfect food", sustainable, and
          protein-rich but relatively low in food energy.
